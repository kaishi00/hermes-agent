"""Transport abstraction for the tui_gateway JSON-RPC server.

Historically the gateway wrote every JSON frame directly to real stdout.  This
module decouples the I/O sink from the handler logic so the same dispatcher
can be driven over stdio (``tui_gateway.entry``) or WebSocket
(``tui_gateway.ws``) without duplicating code.

A :class:`Transport` is anything that can accept a JSON-serialisable dict and
forward it to its peer.  The active transport for the current request is
tracked in a :class:`contextvars.ContextVar` so handlers — including those
dispatched onto the worker pool — route their writes to the right peer.

Backward compatibility
----------------------
``tui_gateway.server.write_json`` still works without any transport bound.
When nothing is on the contextvar and no session-level transport is found,
it falls back to the module-level :class:`StdioTransport`, which wraps the
original ``_real_stdout`` + ``_stdout_lock`` pair.  Tests that monkey-patch
``server._real_stdout`` continue to work because the stdio transport resolves
the stream lazily through a callback.

# Optional knob: when true, StdioTransport does not call ``stream.flush``
# after writing.  Use this on environments where a half-closed pipe (TUI
# Node parent quit while the gateway is still emitting events) makes
# flush block long enough to starve the rest of the worker pool.  Python's
# stdout is line-buffered when attached to a tty and write-through when
# attached to a pipe (the TUI case), so dropping the explicit flush is
# safe on POSIX — the kernel writev still flushes on newline.  Default
# stays off so existing behaviour is unchanged.
