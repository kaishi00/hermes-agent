"""Transport abstraction for the tui_gateway JSON-RPC server.

Historically the gateway wrote every JSON frame directly to real stdout.  This
module decouples the I/O sink from the handler logic so the same dispatcher
can be driven over stdio (``tui_gateway.entry``) or WebSocket
(``tui_gateway.ws``) without duplicating code.

A :class:`Transport` is anything that can accept a JSON-serialisable dict and
forward it to its peer.  The active transport for the current request is
tracked in a :class:`contextvars.ContextVar` so handlers — including those
dispatched onto the worker pool — route their writes to the right peer.

Backward compatibility
----------------------
``tui_gateway.server.write_json`` still works without any transport bound.
When nothing is on the contextvar and no session-level transport is found,
it falls back to the module-level :class:`StdioTransport`, which wraps the
original ``_real_stdout`` + ``_stdout_lock`` pair.  Tests that monkey-patch
``server._real_stdout`` continue to work because the stdio transport resolves
the stream lazily through a callback.

# Optional knob: when true, StdioTransport does not call ``stream.flush``
# after writing.  Use this on environments where a half-closed pipe (TUI
# Node parent quit while the gateway is still emitting events) makes
# flush block long enough to starve the rest of the worker pool.
#
# IMPORTANT: Python text stdout is fully buffered when attached to a
# pipe (the TUI case), so this knob ONLY makes sense when the gateway
# is launched with ``-u`` or ``PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1``.  Without one of
# those, JSON-RPC frames will accumulate in the buffer and the TUI
# will hang waiting for ``gateway.ready``.  Default stays off so the
# existing flush-after-write behaviour is unchanged.
